    "### Introduction\n",
    "Here I have created a basic code to show the how to use TensorFlow and buidl CNN for classification of MNIST Handwritten digit dataset. We can achieve accuracy of 97% using fully connected nerual network. But using simple CNN we can achieve accuracy over 99%.\n",

    "Convolutional Networks work by moving small filters across the input image. This means the filters are re-used for recognizing patterns throughout the entire input image. This makes the Convolutional Networks much more powerful than Fully-Connected networks with the same number of variables. This in turn makes the Convolutional Networks faster to train."

    "These are inspired from the Wiesel and Hubel research on analysis of visual cortex, development of the visual system and description of ocular dominance columns for which they have won Nobel Prize.\n",

    "Below image is representation of convolutional neural networks in LeNet style (The LeNet architecture was first introduced by LeCun et al. in their 1998 paper, Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition). If input image is Black & weight i.e. binary then it has only single channel i.e. only set of pixel values will be present. If input image is a Color image then we have three channels i.e. one set of pixels for primary colors RGB. If we apply `n` different set of filters on any kind of image (B&W or Color) then we end up with `n` different outputs i.e. each filter gives one output. Each of the `n` filters can have `m` subset of filters based on no. of channels for example if image is B&W then we have `1` channel hence `m = 1`, if color then we have `3` channels hence `m = 3`. Also, after applying first convolution layer on given image (B&W or Color) we can have output with `p` no. of channels, then in that case `m` for next layer will be equal to `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In below picture we can see that we start with 3 channel image and 128 x 128 pixels. Then we apply filter of some size (it can be anything) since we have 3 channels in the image each filter we apply will have 3 channels and we have 16 of those. Size of the output remains same because we can pad the input to maintain size of input and ouput to be same. In each convolutional layer some kind of activation function is applied. Calculation of the output of convolutional is simple, it is nothing but dot product of the filter applied on the image. After this people do max-pooling (sometimes location of the feature is not important) to decrease the resolution of the image. This is done by taking max value of the pixel in that image. We can other variants like L2 pooling etc. There is no activation function after pooling operation. This process is repeated until we extracted the important information/features from the images. Finally we have a fully-connected layer for doing the classification. This process reduces no. of trainable parameters required drastically [link](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/). \n",

    "### Convolutional Layer\n",
    "The following chart shows the basic idea of processing an image in the first convolutional layer. The input image depicts the number 7 and four copies of the image are shown here, so we can see more clearly how the filter is being moved to different positions of the image. For each position of the filter, the dot-product is being calculated between the filter and the image pixels under the filter, which results in a single pixel in the output image. So moving the filter across the entire input image results in a new image being generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red filter-weights means that the filter has a positive reaction to black pixels in the input image, while blue pixels means the filter has a negative reaction to black pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it appears that the filter recognizes the horizontal line of the 7-digit, as can be seen from its stronger reaction to that line in the output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images\\1.png \"Fig.2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The step-size for moving the filter across the input is called the stride. There is a stride for moving the filter horizontally (x-axis) and another stride for moving vertically (y-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, the stride is set to 1 in both directions, which means the filter starts in the upper left corner of the input image and is being moved 1 pixel to the right in each step. When the filter reaches the end of the image to the right, then the filter is moved back to the left side and 1 pixel down the image. This continues until the filter has reached the lower right corner of the input image and the entire output image has been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the filter reaches the end of the right-side as well as the bottom of the input image, then it can be padded with zeroes (white pixels). This causes the output image to be of the exact same dimension as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the output of the convolution may be passed through a so-called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which merely ensures that the output is positive because negative values are set to zero. The output may also be down-sampled by so-called max-pooling, which considers small windows of 2x2 pixels and only keeps the largest of those pixels. This halves the resolution of the input image e.g. from 28x28 to 14x14 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second convolutional layer is more complicated because it takes 16 input channels. We want a separate filter for each input channel, so we need 16 filters instead of just one. Furthermore, we want 36 output channels from the second convolutional layer, so in total we need 16 x 36 = 576 filters for the second convolutional layer. It can be a bit challenging to understand how this works."

    "### Flowchart\n",
    "The following chart shows roughly how the data flows in the Convolutional Neural Network that is implemented below. **Note:** below flow chart shows everything correct but the weights shown in the picture are stacked based on channel not the filter i.e., if each (6, 6) weight image grid shown in the color corresponds to one channel stream. For example take convolution layer 2: it must be interpreted as each color image of the weight presented in first row and first column in the first grid combined with the all 16 makes one filter. Hence by combining each (row, col) weight element from all grids we end up creating 36 filters with 16 input channels. Look at the last section where you can weights are plotted based on filters. This image is here just for reference. ![alt text](images\\2.png \"Fig.3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Flowcharts depicts what has been descibed above. The input image is processed in the first convolutional layer using the filter-weights. This results in 16 new images, one for each filter in the convolutional layer. The images are also down-sampled so the image resolution is decreased from 28x28 to 14x14.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 16 smaller images are then processed in the second convolutional layer. We need filter-weights for each of these 16 channels, and we need filter-weights for each output channel of this layer. There are 36 output channels so there are a total of 16 x 36 = 576 filters in the second convolutional layer. The resulting images are down-sampled again to 7x7 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the second convolutional layer is 36 images of 7x7 pixels each. These are then flattened to a single vector of length 7 x 7 x 36 = 1764, which is used as the input to a fully-connected layer with 128 neurons (or elements). This feeds into another fully-connected layer with 10 neurons, one for each of the classes, which is used to determine the class of the image, that is, which number is depicted in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional filters are initially chosen at random, so the classification is done randomly. The error between the predicted and true class of the input image is measured as the so-called cross-entropy. The optimizer then automatically propagates this error back through the Convolutional Network using the chain-rule of differentiation and updates the filter-weights so as to improve the classification error. This is done iteratively thousands of times until the classification error is sufficiently low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the computation in TensorFlow is actually done on a batch of images instead of a single image, which makes the computation more efficient. This means the flowchart actually has one more data-dimension when implemented in TensorFlow."

    "### Practical implementation\n",
    "In theory CNN architecture says `Convolutional Layer - Non-linear Activation - Pooling Layer` but in practice we do `Convolutional Layer - Pooling Layer - Non-linear Activation`. There is nice reasoning for this in the following [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35543428/activation-function-after-pooling-layer-or-convolutional-layer). It says that if we have non-decreasing non-linear activation functions then order doesn't matter becasue they satisfy commutative property. This can be verified by doing experiments and observing that we end up with same amount performance. Also, applying activation function helps to decrease the computation time (it may not matter sometimes because max time spent while doing convolution). "

TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed, while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a time.\n",

This is because the graph is a combination of simple arithmetic expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule for derivatives.\n",

    "TensorFlow can also take advantage of multi-core CPUs as well as GPUs - and Google has even built special chips just for TensorFlow which are called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) that are even faster than GPUs.\n",

    "A TensorFlow graph consists of the following parts (and many more):\n",
    "* Placeholder: variables used to feed input into the graph.\n",
    "* Model variables: that are going to be optimized so as to make the model perform better.\n",
    "* Model: which is essentially just a mathematical function that calculates some output given the input in the placeholder variables and the model variables.\n",
    "* Cost: measure that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.\n",
